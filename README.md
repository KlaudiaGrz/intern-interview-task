# Overview

The purpose of this task is to check basic skills of a technical writer and give you a glimpse of what technical writers do and what tools they use. We will verify the approach you adopt to solve a problem, and we will learn more about the techniques you use. 

# Task

## Step 1

Please **fork** this repository and create a new file in the **tasks** folder. Name the file after your GitHub user name. The file must have an **.md** extension. For example, **abcxyz.md**.

## Step 2

Add content to the new file. Use the following instructions:

Create a document for clients of a company. Write release notes that provide readers with everything they need to know about a new product or an update to a product the company released. 

**NOTE**: All the details, such as the company name, product type, etc. are entirely up to you. Neither the company nor the product need to be IT or software related. 

Write the release notes in [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) and include the following Markdown elements: 
-	A heading
- A list
- Bold font
-	Italic font
- A link

The document needs to have between 200 and 250 words.

Hint: Use the **Preview changes** option or YaaS [Content Editor](https://devportal.yaas.io/tools/documentationsdk/index.html#ContentEditor) to check if your Markdown displays correctly.

## Step 3 

Create a **pull request** back to this repository.

# Expected outcome

The expected outcome is a [pull request](https://github.com/Writers-Instagram/intern-interview-task/pulls) with your file and its content.
